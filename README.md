<h1>Startup-Engineering</h1>

<p>This is my first online course at Coursera.org and it was truly awesome and inspiring.<br>
I decided to put it on GitHub to share with everyone who likes to say "hello world" :)</p>

<p>If you'd like to check out the full course, you can find it here:<br><a href="https://class.coursera.org/startup-001/">https://class.coursera.org/startup-001/</a></p>

<p>Enjoy!</p>
